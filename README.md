# Tiverton-Advisors-Case-Study
Question 2 from case study for Data Engineering Analyst Role

This analysis started with an overview of the data in Data Wrangler, an extension in VS Code that I've found very useful when attempting to quickly glean surface-level insights from a new dataset. From there, I broke down into deeper EDA and data correction/cleaning, creating some graphs illustrating some assumptions that I made about the distribution of the data.

I used DuckDB to write the SQL queries for this assignment, pulling from the cleaned dataset saved as "data_cleaned" within the Python environment when the user runs all chunks in this notebook.

A memo to an investment analyst is present at the bottom of this notebook, including some summarized insights from our SQL queries and notes about data cleaning procedures completed (and not completed).
